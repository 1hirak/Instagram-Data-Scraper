## Instagram-Super-Scraper V 2.1

Instagram Super Scraper is a PHP script which takes http://www.instagram/user-name/ as input and returns all information
related to user e.g. likes, comments, post count, images, likes on images etc... Currently only User Name, Biography, Followers,
Following, Posts, Likes, Comments & Views data in displaying. For other details you have to enable from php script code, Update
Controller/Instagram Class "public $result_type = 'JSON' or 'ARRAY';"

jQuery is using to build the Awesome View, to handle each and every request separately. I hope you like this small chunk of code

## What is Instagram Scraper

> The Instagram Scrapper is a PHP, Html, jQuery Script to get user's data from their Instagram account url.
> Example: https://www.instagram.com/any-user-name/, You can add any link and can get their Total Likes, Total Posts, Comments etc.
> You can also get their post images but it's just a POC so you have to change PHP Code. What you need to just decode json string >and parse by PHP arrays... let me know if you like or want improvement..
