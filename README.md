# Instagram-Super-Scraper

Instagram Super Scraper is a PHP script which takes http://www.instagram/user-name/ as input and returns all information
related to user e.g. likes, comments, post count, images, likes on images etc...

jQuery is using to build the Awesome View, to handle each and every request separately. I hope you like this small chunk of code

All code is well commented to understand the flow and functionality, if I missed something or
any improvement/suggestion you have, kindly let me know.. ....
