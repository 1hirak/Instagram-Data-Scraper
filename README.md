# What is Instagram Scraper

the Instagram Scrapper is a PHP, Html, jQuery Script to get user's data from their Instagram account url.

Example: https://www.instagram.com/any-user-name/, You can add any link and can get their Total Likes, Total Posts, Comments etc.
You can also get their post images but it's just a POC so you have to change PHP Code. What you need to just decode json string and
parse by PHP arrays... let me know if you like or want improvement..
